                    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                        <li>vegetable oil for frying</li>
                        <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>                            
                        <li>6 tablespoons garlic salt</li>                            
                        <li>3 tablespoons ground black pepper</li>
                        <li>4 large eggs, beaten</li>
                        <li>8 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into small chunks</li>
                    <h3>Directions</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Gather all ingredients. Heat 1 inch oil in a large skillet or saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                            <li>Stir together flour, garlic salt, and pepper in a bowl. Dip chicken pieces into beaten eggs, then press 
                                each piece into flour mixture to coat well; shake off excess flour. Place coated chicken pieces onto a plate.</li>
                            <li>Working in batches, fry chicken in hot oil until golden brown and no longer pink in the center.</li>
                            <li>An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Serve and enjoy!</li>
